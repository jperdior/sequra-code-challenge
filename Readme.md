# Sequra challenge

## Arquitectural decisions

- Framework: I decided to use symfony as it's the framework I am more familiar with and it comes with out of the box dependency injection, routing, ORM, message broker, etc.
- Database: MySQL
- Message broker: RabbitMQ

## Requirements

- Docker
- Docker-compose
- Make
- Available ports 8080, 27017, 3306, 8888

## My approach



## Running the project

- Clone the repository
- Run `make start`
